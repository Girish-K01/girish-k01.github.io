JIGS integrates Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchanges with nonce-based AES-128 encryption, providing forward secrecy and key authentication. Its modular design enables adaptation across diverse implementation scenarios, and Python-based prototyping facilitates rapid performance optimization.

Experimental results indicate a processing speed improvement of up to 96.67% through parallelization, particularly for handling larger data sizes. A security analysis further validates the architecture's resilience against common attack vectors while also acknowledging the inherent trade-offs between computational efficiency and cryptographic strength.

The implementation code is available at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Girish-K01/jigs-crypto-code-repo
