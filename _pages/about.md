## What I Focus On
- **Federated Learning & Edge AI** — Built a multimodal wildlife monitoring framework (87.6% audio, 69.9% vision accuracy) with <2MB models on NVIDIA DGX.  
- **Secure AI Systems** — Designed parallelized ECDH/AES messaging (96% faster), and ML-driven honeypots for adaptive defense.  
- **Neurotechnology & Research** — Founder of *GreyLattice*, where I publish deep-dives on brain-computer interfaces, decoding, and AI inspired by neuroscience.  



## Recent Highlights
- 2 peer-reviewed publications in AI security & cryptography  
- GPU-accelerated financial sentiment system: reduced latency 8 min → 10 sec  
- Technical Speaker: CUDA Seminar (50+ attendees)  
- B.Tech CSE (VIT Chennai, graduating 2025, CGPA 8.69/10)  



## Open To
- Research collaborations in federated learning, security, or computational neuroscience  
- Internships with labs/companies advancing AI systems, BCI, or edge computing  
- Projects at the boundary of **engineering and research**
