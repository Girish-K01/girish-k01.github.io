I’m **Girish Kulathumani**, a Computer Science undergraduate with a focus on **high-performance systems, machine learning, and applied cryptography**. My work lies at the intersection of **AI, systems engineering, and security**, where I build intelligent infrastructures that are fast, privacy-preserving, and scalable — both in code and concept.

As a developer, I design and optimize pipelines for real-time analytics, secure communication, and edge-compatible AI. As a researcher, I explore deeper questions about perception, cognition, and the evolving architectures of intelligence — both biological and artificial.

## Research & Development Focus

### 1. **Federated & Multimodal Learning Systems**
I currently lead the design of **HabitatFL**, a privacy-preserving framework for wildlife monitoring that integrates:
- **Federated Learning** with dynamic configurations and resource-aware strategies  
- **Multimodal perception models** (vision and audio) optimized for edge inference  
- **Open conservation datasets** like WCS and FSC22, restructured for distributed learning

This work aims to support ecological research while advancing edge-AI efficiency and privacy techniques.

### 2. **Secure Systems & Cryptographic Protocols**
Through my project **JIGSaw**, I’ve developed a lightweight, parallelized secure messaging architecture featuring:
- A modified **Double Ratchet algorithm**
- **AES-GCM** encryption with advanced key management
- A **parallel-processing pipeline** with formal safety guarantees  
- Experimental extensions into **cryptobiological evolution** and attacker-defender simulations

My current research also explores **complexity-based cryptography**, where security derives from problem hardness simplifiable only through privileged decryption keys — drawing on SAT, lattice problems, and game theory.

### 3. **Neuroscience-Inspired Computing**
My long-term interest lies in bridging **computational neuroscience** and **AI architectures**. I’m actively exploring:
- **Brain decoding models** for perception reconstruction  
- **Recursive Perception Architectures**, a novel cognitive engine that can rewrite its own perceptual rules  
- **Meta-creative AI systems** capable of redefining their aesthetic frameworks, inspired by human creativity and abstraction hierarchies

I regularly write and publish insights on these themes through my research blog, [GreyLattice](https://greylattice.substack.com).

## Philosophy of Work

I approach systems as evolving, interpretable structures — not just codebases. Whether it's optimizing neural inference on GPUs or designing algorithms that adapt like biological entities, I care about **clarity, modularity, and theoretical rigor**.

> *"Code should not only execute well — it should think clearly."*

This mindset has led me to develop tools and frameworks that are both technically sound and conceptually grounded.
