**GLr01** marks the first entry in *GreyLattice Research (GLr)* — a new subseries dedicated to unpacking complex research papers in Computational Neuroscience and making their insights accessible from first principles.

This post breaks down the paper:  
**"Brain Decoding: Toward Real-Time Reconstruction of Visual Perception"**  
*Arxiv ID: [2310.19812](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19812)*

The study presents a fascinating blend of MEG-based brain signal decoding, deep learning, and real-time visual reconstruction—pushing the boundaries of what’s possible at the intersection of neuroscience and AI.

I discovered this paper while working on a personal project, and it left a strong impression. As a result, I decided not only to dissect its key findings and methods, but also to launch this GLr series to share such insights with the broader GreyLattice community.
