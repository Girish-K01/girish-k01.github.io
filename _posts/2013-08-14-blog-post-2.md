**GreyLattice-01 (GL01)** kicks off the *GreyLattice* blog with a foundational look at the field of Computational Neuroscience.

Even though the term feels modern, “Computational Neuroscience” was first coined in 1985 by Eric L. Schwartz at a conference in Carmel, California. Since then, it has grown into a critical discipline for understanding how the brain processes information—and how we can replicate or interface with that process using machines.

This inaugural post explores the early history and motivations behind the field, setting the stage for future deep dives into brain-computer interfaces, neuromorphic architectures, and more.
