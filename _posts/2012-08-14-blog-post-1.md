**GreyLattice-00 (GL00)** is the official launch post for *GreyLattice*, a blog dedicated to decoding the brain and building intelligent systems through the lens of Computational Neuroscience.

The name “GreyLattice” reflects the intricate architecture of the brain’s grey matter and the networked complexity of the mind. In this opening post, I lay out the motivation behind the blog, what readers can expect, and why this field—at the intersection of neuroscience, computer science, and artificial intelligence—deserves your attention.

Whether you're a curious student, an experienced researcher, or just someone fascinated by minds and machines, *GreyLattice* is a space for accessible yet in-depth explorations of neural coding, network dynamics, plasticity, and cognitive architectures.
